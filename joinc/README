This directory contains the Joinc implementation. You can find the 
Java sources in the directory:
 
     ./src/joinc 

To build Joinc you can use ant. Make sure your ant setup is correct 
(see the web page for more information). 

You can set the location of the JavaGAT by setting the 'javagat-location'
in the 'build.properties' file. Note that default setting is correct for 
use on the fs0 machine. 

You can then type

     ant build        to build joinc
     ant docs         to build the javadoc documentation. 
     ant clean        to clean the tree


Enjoy!
